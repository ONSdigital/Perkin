# sdx-collect

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ONSdigital/sdx-collect.svg?branch=python-consumer)](https://travis-ci.org/ONSdigital/sdx-collect)

``sdx-collect`` is a component of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Survey Data Exchange (SDX) project which listens to a queue for survey data from the eQ Survey Runner.

On receipt it hands off to sdx-decrypt to decrypt the survey data, validates the result with sdx-validate and then stores the json by calling sdx-store. Once complete the survey is receipted
via the appropriate receipting service.
